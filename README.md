This repository is a copy of Sagnik Ghosh's code that can be seen in his own repository via the link below https://github.com/sagnikghoshcr7/Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction



Another repository that might be of interest is https://github.com/zunicd/Bank-Churn-Prediction. His metrics are slightly different than the models' of the notebook in this repository. He also uses Keras to create a deep learning model that is interesting to compare to the metrics of the other machine learning techniques.
